# Arithmetic Operators
# Assignment Operators
# Comparison Operators
# Logical Operators
# Identity Operators
# Membership Operators
# Bitwise Operators

# Arithmetic Operators
# print("5 + 6 = ", 5 + 6)
# print("5 - 6 = ", 5 - 6)
# print("5 * 6 = ", 5 * 6)
# print("5 / 6 = ", 5 / 6)
# print("5 ** 6 = ", 5 ** 6)   # power
# print("15 // 6 = ", 15 // 6) # output is integer (divide)
# print("5 % 6 = ", 5 % 6)

# Assignment Operators
# x = 5
# x += 7  # +=, -=, *=, /=
# print(x)

# Comparison Operators
# i = 8
# print(i == 6)  # !=, <=, >=

# Logical Operators
# a = True
# b = False
# print(b and b)  # and, or

# Identity Operators
# p = 5
# q = 9
# print(p is not q)

# Membership Operators
# u = 3
# list1 = [4, 1, 9, 3, 58]
# print(u not in list1)

# Bitwise Operators
# 0 - 00
# 1 - 01
# 2 - 10
# 3 - 11
print(1 & 3)
print(0 | 2)
